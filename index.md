**Hello!**

I’m an Android developer 💻.

I love the work I do as an Android Developer. I enjoy learning about new things, and applying them to my work. You can keep up to date on the things I've been working on by subscribing to my newsletter 📬.

You can often find me at conferences exchanging information with others as a speaker 🎤. Come say hello if you spot me at one!

In addition to speaking at conferences, I also write for Ray Wenderlich ✏️. I'm a part of their Android team, helping to educate people in Android and Kotlin.

Dance is another important part of my life. I’ve taken classes in various styles since kindergarten, but these days I spend most my time taking tap classes 🎵.

While studying at Hope College, I also started getting involved in dance technology and dance production 🎭. I had a couple projects that worked together with a dancer and an Xbox Kinect, and did a significant amount of lighting design. Ask me about them, I love talking about it!

When I’m not out doing these things, you can find me in my home base of Chicago 🏙️ with my partner, Tyler. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends, or curled up at home with a good book, my cat, Peter Pan 😻, and hedgehog, Khoshekh 🦔.
