**Hello!**

I’m an Android developer 💻.

I love the work I do as an Android Developer. I enjoy learning about new things, and applying them to my work. You can keep up to date on the things I've been working on by subscribing to my [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/vgonda) 📬.

You can often find me at conferences exchanging information with others as a [speaker](talks.md) 🎤. Come say hello if you spot me at one!

In addition to speaking at conferences, I also write for [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/vgonda) ✏️ in my spare time. I'm a part of their Android team, helping to educate people in Android and Kotlin. As part of my work there, I co-authored the book _[Android Test-Driven Development by Tutorials](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/android-test-driven-development-by-tutorials)_.

While studying at [Hope College](https://hope.edu/), I also started getting involved in dance technology and dance production 🎭. I had a couple projects that worked together with a dancer and an Xbox Kinect, and did a significant amount of lighting design. Ask me about them, I love talking about it!

When I’m not out doing these things, you can find me in my home base of Chicago 🏙️ with my partner, Tyler. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends, or curled up at home with a good book, my cat, [Peter Pan](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgoGqmRlGSk/) 😻, and hedgehog, [Khoshekh](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bge6vC0h1Cx/) 🦔.
