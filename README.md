## [Transforming your Tests with Kotlin](talks/transform_your_tests.md)

We know we should write tests, and we know that Kotlin gives us some nice features to use in our code, so how can we put these two together? There are some really great ways that Kotlin is being used in test writing, and we'll look at a number of them. This will include features such as higher order functions and escaping back-ticks and how they can make your tests more expressive. We'll also look at some testing libraries that take advantage of Kotlin's features. At the end of this talk you'll walk away with an understanding of how you can use Kotlin to make your tests more enjoyable.

## [Getting Started with AndroidX Test](talks/androidx_test.md)

Testing on Android is slowly becoming more approachable. With AndroidX Test, you can use a single test API to run your instrumentation tests either on your mobile device, or on your computer using Robolectric. This is great, so how do you start? In this talk you’ll learn how to use AndroidX Test and Espresso to get started writing Integration tests for your app. [Resources](talks/androidx_test.md)

## [Let Kotlin Come To You](talks/let_kotlin_come_to_you.md)

Kotlin is a statically typed, multi-platform language, developed by JetBrains. It’s use has increased dramatically in the past year. What does the language offer us, and why might we choose it? In this talk we’ll go over some of the basics of Kotlin, the benefits, and how we can use it in our day to day development. You will walk away from this talk with the tools you need to get started learning and building with Kotlin, whether you’re working with the JVM, JavaScript, or native.
