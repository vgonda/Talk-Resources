## Let Kotlin Come To You

Kotlin is a statically typed, multi-platform language, developed by JetBrains. It’s use has increased dramatically in the past year. What does the language offer us, and why might we choose it? In this talk we’ll go over some of the basics of Kotlin, the benefits, and how we can use it in our day to day development. You will walk away from this talk with the tools you need to get started learning and building with Kotlin, whether you’re working with the JVM, JavaScript, or native.
