    <h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>
  I’m an Android developer 💻 and dancer 🎶.
</p>
<p>
  I love the work I do at
  <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>
  on their Android team. I enjoy learning about new things, and applying them to my work. You can keep up to date on the things I've been working on by subscribing to my
  <a href="http://www.victoriagonda.com/subscribe">newsletter</a> 📬.
</p>
<p>
  You can often find me at conferences exchanging information with others as a
  <a href="http://www.victoriagonda.com/talks">speaker</a> 🎤. Come say hello if you spot me at one!
</p>
<p>
  In addition to speaking at conferences, I also write for
  <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/">Ray Wenderlich</a> ✏️. I'm a part of their Android team, helping to educate people in Android and Kotlin.
</p>
<p>
  Dance is another important part of my life. I’ve taken classes in various styles since kindergarten, but these days I spend most my time taking tap classes 🎵.
</p>
<p>
  While studying at
  <a href="https://hope.edu/">Hope College</a>, I also started getting involved in dance technology and dance production 🎭. I had a couple projects that worked together with a dancer and an Xbox Kinect, and did a significant amount of lighting design. Ask me about them, I love talking about it!
</p>
<p>
  When I’m not out doing these things, you can find me in my home base of Chicago 🏙️ with my partner, Tyler. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends, or curled up at home with a good book, my cat,
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/peterpan_the_cat/">Peter Pan</a> 😻, and hedgehog,
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/khoshekh_the_hedgehog/">Khoshekh</a> 🦔.
